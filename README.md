# Fake-News-Detection
 This project analyzes fake and real news articles using NLP techniques and an SVM classifier. By performing sentiment analysis, word cloud, and bar chart visualizations, we identified common themes and linguistic patterns in both types of news. The resulting model achieved high accuracy in predicting whether an article is fake or real.
